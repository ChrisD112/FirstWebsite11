        <h1>Capitals Prospects</h1>
        <p> The Washington Capitals have a promising crop of young talent in their system. At the top is Ryan Leonard, a powerful forward recently signed from Boston College who already saw some NHL action. Ivan Miroshnichenko showed off some offensive flair in the AHL with Hershey and could push for a full-time NHL role, while Cole Hutson is a highly skilled defenseman from Boston University who stands out with poise and playmaking ability. Meanwhile, Lynden Lakovic is a big, skilled winger from the WHL with size and a scoring touch that could make him a future top-six forward.</p>
