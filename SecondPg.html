        <h1>The Stanley Cup</h1>
        <p> The Stanley Cup is the championship trophy awarded annually to the winner of the National Hockey League. After an 82-game regular season, sixteen teams enter the playoffs to compete for a chance to win it. The playoffs consist of four intense rounds, each decided in a best-of-seven series. The team that survives all four rounds earns the right to hoist the Stanley Cup. As the oldest trophy in North American professional sports, first awarded in 1893, it remains one of the most iconic symbols in all of hockey.
